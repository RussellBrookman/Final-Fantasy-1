# Final-Fantasy-1

A re-creation of a battle from the classic Nintendo game by Square Enix which can be run on most or all modern web browsers. This was built purely for the fun of making it. I created this using pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It's fun to play. The directions are on screen but to add more monsters press the spacebar. If you have a minute feel free to give it a try and tell me what you think.
	
# Prerequisites

* Just a spacebar key


# Dependencies

* jQuery
